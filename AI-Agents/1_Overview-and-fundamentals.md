## Definition of AI Agents

Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are autonomous software systems designed to perceive their environment, reason about it, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specified goals on behalf of users or other systems. These agents demonstrate competencies such as learning, planning, adaptation, and interaction with dynamic, multi-modal inputs including text, voice, images, and structured data.

Unlike traditional software, AI agents exhibit a degree of autonomy, enabling them to perform complex, multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention. They integrate capabilities drawn from machine learning (especially large language models), natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and symbolic reasoning.

## Key Types and Taxonomy

AI agents can be categorized based on their complexity, autonomy, and function:

- **Reactive Agents**: Perform actions based solely on current sensory inputs, lacking internal state or memory.
- **Deliberative Agents**: Maintain internal state and plan ahead using symbolic reasoning and models of the environment.
- **Learning Agents**: Improve performance over time by learning from experience and feedback.
- **Utility-Based Agents**: Make decisions to maximize a defined utility function balancing trade-offs.
- **Hierarchical Agents**: Organized in layers where high-level agents decompose tasks into subgoals assigned to lower-level agents.
- **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**: Collections of interacting agents collaborating or competing to achieve individual or joint objectives.
- **Conversational Agents (Chatbots)**: Specialized agents focusing on natural language interaction as primary interface.
- **Physical/Robotic Agents**: Embodied agents that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators.

## Agent Architectures

AI agent architectures can be realized through several design paradigms depending on application requirements:

- **Deliberative Architecture**: Based on the symbolic processing of beliefs, desires, and intentions (BDI model), emphasizing planning and logical inference.
- **Reactive Architecture**: Uses condition-action rules and direct mappings from perception to action, prioritizing speed over planning.
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines deliberation and reactivity, layering fast reflexive mechanisms with slower, plan-based reasoning.
- **Learning-Based Architecture**: Incorporates reinforcement learning or supervised learning components for policy optimization within agent decision pipelines.
- **Modular Architecture**: Separates perception, reasoning, learning, and action components with well-defined interfaces for scalability.

## Historical Evolution

The concept of AI agents traces back to early artificial intelligence and robotics research in the 1950s and 1960s, with foundational work in automated reasoning, expert systems, and autonomous robotics.

Key milestones include:

- **1970s-80s**: Development of rule-based expert systems and initial explorations of software agents.
- **1990s**: Emergence of autonomous agents in software applications, agent communication languages (ACL), and multi-agent systems theory.
- **2000s**: Expansion of agents in web services, intelligent assistants, and mobile computing.
- **2010s to Present**: AI agents increasingly leverage deep learning and transformer-based architectures (LLMs) for complex language understanding, planning, and autonomous execution.
- **Modern Trends**: Emphasis on hierarchical multi-agent coordination, explainability, adaptive learning, and integration with real-world environments and IoT.

This evolution reflects a shift from fixed, brittle rule-based systems toward adaptive, context-aware, and cooperative intelligent agents capable of tackling real-world complexity at scale.
