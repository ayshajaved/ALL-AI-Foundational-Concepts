## Definition of AI Agents

Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are autonomous systems capable of perceiving their environment, reasoning about it, making decisions, and executing actions to achieve specific goals. They leverage techniques from machine learning, natural language processing, symbolic reasoning, and multi-modal perception to operate effectively in complex, dynamic environments.

Unlike traditional software, AI agents demonstrate autonomy, adaptability, learning, and multi-step problem-solving, enabling them to function with minimal human intervention.

## Key Types and Taxonomy of AI Agents

AI agents can be organized by **capability levels** reflecting their problem-solving sophistication and autonomy:

- **Level 0: Core Reasoning System**  
  Fundamental logical inference and symbolic reasoning capabilities forming the agent’s cognitive basis.

- **Level 1: Connected Problem Solver**  
  Basic problem-solving operating with environmental awareness and reactive planning techniques.

- **Level 2: Strategic Problem-Solver**  
  Incorporates long-term foresight, adaptive planning, and strategic decision-making frameworks.

- **Level 3: Collaborative Agent**  
  Engages in cooperation and teamwork with other agents and human collaborators, sharing knowledge and responsibilities.

- **Level 4: Self-Evolving System**  
  Exhibits autonomous self-monitoring, learning, and architectural adaptation, evolving over time based on experience.

## Common AI Agent Types by Behavior and Architecture

- **Reactive Agents:** Operate solely on current sensory inputs without memory or internal state, responding reflexively.  
- **Deliberative Agents:** Maintain internal world models and perform ahead-of-time planning and reasoning.  
- **Learning Agents:** Improve performance continuously through feedback and experience.  
- **Utility-Based Agents:** Make decisions to maximize a utility function balancing competing objectives.  
- **Hierarchical Agents:** Organized in levels, decomposing complex tasks through layered subgoals and delegated control.  
- **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS):** Collections of agents interacting cooperatively or competitively to solve complex problems.  
- **Conversational Agents (Chatbots):** Specialized for natural language interaction as their primary user interface.  
- **Physical/Robotic Agents:** Embodied agents interacting physically with the world via sensors and actuators.

## Agent Architectures

Key architectures driving AI agents include:

- **Reactive:** Rule-based, fast response with minimal deliberation.
- **Deliberative:** Symbolic reasoning with planning modules.
- **Hybrid:** Merging reactive and deliberative capabilities.
- **Learning-Based:** Incorporate reinforcement or supervised learning to adapt and optimize.
