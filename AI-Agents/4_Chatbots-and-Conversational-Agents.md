## Introduction

Chatbots and conversational agents constitute a specialized class of AI agents designed to engage users in natural language interactions. Leveraging advancements in natural language processing (NLP), dialogue management, and increasingly large language models (LLMs), chatbots serve as interactive front-ends, bridging users with complex data, services, or autonomous functionalities.

## Defining Chatbots vs. Conversational Agents

- **Chatbots:** Typically task-oriented software systems interacting primarily through text or voice, performing specific functions such as customer support, information retrieval, or simple transactions.
- **Conversational Agents:** Encompass broader AI systems capable of more advanced multi-turn dialogues, context retention, emotion recognition, and proactive engagement.

## Core Technologies Behind Chatbots

- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Extracts user intent and entities from input.
- **Dialogue Management:** Determines flow and state of conversations.
- **Natural Language Generation (NLG):** Constructs coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
- **Large Language Models:** Transformers pretrained on vast corpora, providing flexibility, creativity, and context awareness.

## Chatbots in the AI Ecosystem

- Act as the **primary interface** for many AI applications, democratizing access to AI-powered tools.
- Integrate with backend AI agents for complex task execution, enabling hybrid architectures.
- Employ reinforcement learning and user feedback to improve over time.

## Types of Chatbots

- **Rule-Based:** Operate on predefined patterns and scripted responses.
- **Retrieval-Based:** Select best response from a database using similarity metrics.
- **Generative (LLM-Powered):** Generate novel and context-aware responses dynamically.
- **Hybrid:** Combine retrieval and generative techniques for enhanced reliability and creativity.
