# The Broad Hierarchies of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

This structured guide collects **all major broad AI hierarchies** as recognized in research, industry, and technical literature. Categories are presented by capability, learning paradigm, technical methodology, application domain, and functional approach. Each major hierarchy table includes representative examples for clarity.

## 1. AI Capability-Based Hierarchy

AI is commonly classified by its *theoretical capability*—how intelligent and adaptable the system is.


| Capability Level | Description | Example Models/Systems |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) | Specialized, single-task AI ("weak" AI) | Spam filter, facial recognition |
| Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) | Human-equivalent, multi-task AI ("strong" AI, currently theoretical) | None yet (hypothetical AGI agents) |
| Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) | AI outperforming humans in all domains (theoretical/future) | Not yet possible |


***

## 2. AI Functionality-Based Hierarchy

Organizes AI by what it *does* and how it operates internally:[^2][^5]


| Functional Type | Description | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Reactive Machines | Responds only to current inputs, no memory/context | Chess programs, Deep Blue |
| Limited Memory | Remembers and uses some past data for decision making | Self-driving car, voice assistants |
| Theory of Mind | (Theoretical) Understands emotions, intentions, others' mental states | Rare in practice |
| Self-aware | (Theoretical) AI with conscious sense of self | Not yet developed |

## 3. AI Learning Paradigm Hierarchy

Classifies AI systems by *how they learn* and what data they use:


| Learning Approach | Description | Example Models |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Supervised Learning | Learn from labeled data | SVM, decision tree, CNN |
| Unsupervised Learning | Discover structure in unlabeled data | K-means, PCA |

| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Natural Language Processing (NLP) | Language/text understanding \& generation | GPT-4, BERT |
| Computer Vision (CV) | Image and video analysis | CNN, YOLO, ViT |
| Speech/Audio AI | Voice and sound recognition/generation | wav2vec, Whisper |

| Multi-modal AI | Fusion of text, image, audio modalities | Gemini, CLIP |
| Recommender Systems | Personalized suggestion engines | Collaborative filtering, matrix factorization |
| Technical/Functional AI | MLOps, data engineering, integration | AutoML, model serving |
| Human-Machine Interaction | AI for collaboration, empathy | Smart assistants, voice bots |

## 6. AI Hierarchies as 'Tech Stacks' or Pipelines

AI systems often span stack-like layers:

- **AI Core Technologies:** (Symbolic AI, ML, DL, Generative)
- **Foundational Models:** (pretrained general-purpose models)
- **Applied Models:** (domain-specific/fine-tuned)
- **Agentic Systems:** (reasoning, autonomy)
- **Frontier Systems:** (aspirational/AGI, super-AI)
